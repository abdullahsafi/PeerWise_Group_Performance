Due Week 10:  Checkpoint for outline of group product notebooks. 

Due Week 11:  Checkpoint for Github Issues to be resolved in the last week of the project.

Due Week 12:  Video presentation in tute.


## Overview and Motivation

You tackle a data analysis problem, particularly putting into practice all the aspects of the human-in-the-loop data analysis from the lectures and tutorials.

You will complete a data analysis project using Jupyter notebooks to create:

a product notebook: which provide a reproducible analysis created by your group;
a set of process notebooks: with all the data exploration, data engineering and data analysis experiments, including those that were incorporated in the product notebook, created mainly by individuals for pairs of team members.
You will also create a presentation to share your  ethical analysis and final results with your tutorial class. 

A key aspect of this work is your group github repository. This will include a group report linked to evidence of your group co-ordination processes.

## The datasets and the goals for the data analysis.

The motivation, driving problems and core requirements for each dataset will be presented in detail in the Week 6 lecture.

# Topic 2: PeerWise-group 

## Background: 
Gareth Denyer has made extensive use of PeerWise in large classes at Sydney University. He has a set of de-identified data for students who worked in groups which he has classified in terms of their motivation and achievement levels. The data available is from internal PeerWise logs and final exams. Gareth has agreed to be available to discuss this topic with groups taking it on. Students who want to do this project need to be linked to the ethics processes for analysing this data.

## Driving question:
What are the impacts of the group membership for performance using PeerWise.
