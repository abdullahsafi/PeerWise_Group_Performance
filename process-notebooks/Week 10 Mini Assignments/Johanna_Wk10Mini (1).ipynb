              "'When reading this question I got too distracted by reading the table options an trying to figure out which columns are correct and incorrect that I forgot to read the actual question again. Whoops!! Now that I read the question again the correct answer makes sense and is quite easy to identify through process of elimination of the other answers. This question requires students to apply their knowledge in a situation where the sigma subunit is impaired. The fact that you said \"impaired\" rather than not present at all makes the question more challenging. The transcription occurs (Yes/No) column could be a bit confusing but also allows the elimination of A and D as students that are confident with the syllabu content will know that the sigma subunit is involved in the initiation of prokaryotic transcription. This question could be changed into a \"Which row of the table is True/False?\" question or something along those lines which is similar to the style of exam questions.'"
